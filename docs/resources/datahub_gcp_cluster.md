### Nested Schema for `destroy_options`

Optional:

- `force_delete_cluster` (Boolean) An indicator that will take place once the cluster termination will be performed. If it is true, that means if something would go sideways during termination, the operation will proceed, however in such a case no notification would come thus it is advisable to check the cloud provider if there are no leftover resources once the destroy is finished.
