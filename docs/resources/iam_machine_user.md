- `machineUserName` (String) The machine user name.

### Optional

- `status` (String) The current status of the machine user. The possible status values are ACTIVE and CONTROL_PLANE_LOCKED_OUT. ACTIVE indicates that the machine user is active in CDP. An active machine user can authenticate to the CDP control plane and workload clusters. CONTROL_PLANE_LOCKED_OUT indicates that the machine user is locked out of the CDP control plane.

The statuses other than ACTIVE are only returned on Cloudera for Government.
